A flutter based web applciation which allows users to connect, create posts, and send friend requests, and chat with friends.

– Implemented the frontend using **Flutter**, creating interactive user interfaces with widgets and handling user input.

– Integrated backend functionality using **Node.js** and **MongoDB**, allowing users to store and retrieve data from the
database.

– Tech Stacks: Flutter, Dart, Node.js, MongoDB

As this web app is not deployed, you have to follow certain steps to run it:

Step 1:) Go inside the backend folder . Right click and choose the option open with code. Then run app.js file. You should make sure that this javascript is running. (Use play button in VS Code). This will serve as Backend Server.

Step 2:) Go Inside Frontend\project_hercules\build\web and Right click and choose open in terminal. 

Step 3:) Inside the terminal write the command:  python -m http.server

Step 4:) Open Google Chrome and go to http://localhost:8000 and you will see the website

Thanks for looking into my project! Have a nice day!
